Iris Flowers

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

This dataset is particularly popular due to its simplicity and the clear separation of the different species based on the features provided. The four features are all measured in centimeters.

sepal_length: The length of the iris flower's sepals (the green leaf-like structures that encase the flower bud).
sepal_width: The width of the iris flower's sepals.
petal_length: The length of the iris flower's petals (the colored structures of the flower).
petal_width: The width of the iris flower's petals.
species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica

The target variable represents the species of the iris flower and has three classes: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


setosa: The petals of Iris setosa are relatively small and narrow. The sepals are also small and narrow, complementing the petals.For Iris setosa, petal length typically ranges from 1.0 to 2.5 cm, while petal width ranges from 0.1 to 0.6 cm; sepal length is between 4.3 and 5.8 cm, and sepal width is between 2.3 and 4.4 cm.
versicolor: The petals of Iris versicolor are moderate in size, with a slightly broader shape compared to Iris setosa.The sepals are moderately sized and can be slightly wider than those of Iris setosa.For Iris versicolor, petal length typically falls between 2.45 cm and 4.45 cm, with petal width generally ranging from 1.0 cm to 1.5 cm, while sepal length is around 5.5 to 6.5 cm and sepal width is around 2.5 to 3.0 cm.
virginica: The petals of Iris virginica are generally larger and broader than those of the other two species. The sepals are also larger and wider, matching the robust size of the petals.For Iris virginica, petal length typically ranges from 4 to 5.6 cm, petal width from 1.3 to 2.5 cm, sepal length from 5.1 to 7.1 cm, and sepal width from 2.0 to 3.3 cm.
